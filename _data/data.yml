    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
        Hi, my name's David and I'm a system administrator, DB Admin and data guy. I am working in medical IT where I do everything server related from planning and deployment over upkeep like automation, backup concepts and restores up to end of life support like server and database migrations. In my free time I still like to try and learn something new, that's why I am still enrolled in some university courses. I also like cooking, gaming and the weekly roleplaying evening with my friends.

    info:
      - degree: B.Sc. Computer Science
        university: Fernuni Hagen
        time: 2015 - Present
        details: |
          I wanted to get a better foundational understanding of computer science \(since that is not my original background\) and therefore enrolled into the computer science program in Hagen, Germany's only state distance-learning university.</br>As you can see I am taking my time with this program as I am honestly in no rush to finish \(I already have an M.Sc. Molecular Biology\).</br>My main points of focus, at the moment, are data science and data mining, as well as databases and a bit of software development.
      - degree: B.Sc. Biology </br> M.Sc. Molecular Biology
        university: Philipps-Uni Marburg
        time: 2004 - 2009
        details: |
        From 2004 to 2007 I finished my B.Sc. in Biology and M.Sc. in Molecular Biology with a heavy focus on cell and developmental biology, genetics and bioinformatics. My Bachelor's Thesis revolved around Aktin regulating factors during the muscle development of **Drosophila melanogaster**. </br> After my Bachelor's Thesis I had the opportunity to keep working in the Lab of Prof. Renate Renkawitz-Pohl \(this time for money\) where I was conducting a data mining and analysis study to find proteases \(protein eating enzymes\) involved in muscle development. This study would later on provide the topic for my Master's Thesis, which I finished with a grade of 1.6 \(very good\).
